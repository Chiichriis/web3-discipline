FIVE THINGS I LEARNED 
1. some new fuctions (reverse, split, join).
2. learned about the readline function/interface
3. comfortably used the % operator to solve most problems
4. found out that one problem can be solved in different ways like the solutions to Program 3
5. one cannot code efficiently without the internet or in isolation

TWO THINGS I FOUND CONFUSING
1. I had to learn about readline becuse prompt was not working on my console. The readline is still alittle weird to me though i used it effectively.
2. Program 3 was a bit challenging but fun after i had a grasp of it
